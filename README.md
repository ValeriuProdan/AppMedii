# AppMedii
This is an app I designed back in high school, in 2014 I think, when I was in the 11th grade, for one of my teachers who was struggling to find out if some of my colleagues could increase their final average grade.
He was using excel to automatically calculate the average, but he was guessing what grades should my colleagues take in order to increase it.
The app I designed gives this "suggestions" automatically.
In my country the "GPA" for each course is calculated by rounding the average. 
n = number of grade
m[i] = ith grade
t = teza grade ( teza is one special exam, taken at the end of the semester)

GPA = Round  (((m[1] + .. + m[n]) /n * 3 + t ) / 4)
